# Things you'll need

The following items are included in your MEGA65 box:

1. Your MEGA65 personal computer
2. Power supply
3. The MEGA65 User's Guide
4. Your personal registration code, on a piece of paper
5. The internal SD memory card (installed inside the MEGA65)

For this Guide, you will also need:

1. A PC running Windows, Mac, or Linux, with Internet access
2. An SD memory card reader for your PC, with microSD card support or an SD-to-microSD adapter
3. A monitor that supports either DVI (HDMI) or VGA, with an appropriate cable or adapter
4. If not using a monitor that supports audio over HDMI, speakers or headphones with a mini audio plug
5. A microSD memory card, type SDHC, between 4 GB and 32 GB
6. A Phillips head screwdriver

The following are optional but will be fun additions to your MEGA65 experience:

1. A joystick or gamepad compatible with Commodore computers, with a nine-pin (DE-9) connector
2. A Commodore 1351 mouse, an Amiga mouse, or a modern replacement such as a [mouSTer](https://retrohax.net/shop/amiga/mouster/) USB mouse adapter
3. A CR1220 watch battery
4. 3-1/2" floppy disks, either type DD or HD

```{caution}
Do not connect a Sega Genesis game controller directly to the MEGA65 or Commodore computers. Sega Genesis controllers are not compatible and may damage the computer, even though they have the same connector. If you wish to use the Genesis controller, you can use an adapter such as [the BackBit GenAssister](https://store.backbit.io/product/genassister/).
