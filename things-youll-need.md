# Things you'll need

The following items are included in your MEGA65 box:

1. Your MEGA65 personal computer
2. Power supply
3. The MEGA65 User's Guide
4. Your personal registration code, on a piece of paper (possibly tucked into the User's Guide)
5. The internal SD memory card (installed inside the MEGA65)

For this Guide, you will also need:

1. A PC running Windows, Mac, or Linux, with Internet access
2. An SD memory card reader for your PC, with microSD card support or an SD-to-microSD adapter
3. A monitor that supports either DVI (HDMI) or VGA, with an appropriate cable or adapter
4. If not using a monitor that supports audio over HDMI, speakers or headphones with a mini audio plug
5. A microSD memory card, type SDHC, between 4 GB and 32 GB
6. A Phillips head screwdriver

The following are optional but will be fun additions to your MEGA65 experience:

1. A joystick or gamepad compatible with Commodore computers, with a nine-pin (DE-9) connector
2. A Commodore 1351 mouse, an Amiga mouse, or a modern replacement such as a [mouSTer](https://retrohax.net/shop/amiga/mouster/) USB mouse adapter
3. A CR1220 watch battery
4. 3-1/2" floppy disks, either type DD or HD

And if you want to get really serious:

1. The [XMOD FTDI JTAG Adapter TE0790-03](https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/en/TE0790-03-XMOD-FTDI-JTAG-Adapter-Xilinx-compatible)
2. Mini USB B to USB A cable, to connect between your PC and the JTAG adapter

```{tip}
The compatible JTAG adapter is difficult to find right now. Trenz is fulfilling backorders as parts become available. You can [preorder the JTAG adapter](https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/en/TE0790-03-XMOD-FTDI-JTAG-Adapter-Xilinx-compatible) even though "in stock" says zero, and your order will be fulfilled eventually.

Alternatively, you can use a more common USB UART adapter, with important caveats. See [Use of an USB UART adapter as alternative to a JTAG adapter](https://files.mega65.org/html/main.php?ar=f9e8436a-169d-42cb-8274-70d49b6096ba). A misconfigured or mis-wired UART adapter may damage the computer.

Some MEGA65 units have an issue with the built-in Real-Time Clock (RTC). There is an official solution to install a replacement. See {ref}`hardware-issues:the real-time clock doesn't advance the time` for how to test for this issue and request a replacement part if needed.
