MEGA65 Welcome Guide
====================

Hello! You've reached the MEGA65 Welcome Guide. This Guide is intended for new owners of the `MEGA65 personal computer <https://mega65.org/>`_. It contains answers to common questions, and recommends best practices for continued enjoyment of your new computer. It was written as an unofficial supplement to the *MEGA65 User's Guide* included with the computer.

**As of February 2024,** most of this information has been added to the *MEGA65 User's Guide, 2nd edition.* You can `download the PDF <https://files.mega65.org?id=a5081244-a976-4a21-9153-27cca13fd613>`_, or `purchase a professionally printed copy <https://files.mega65.org?ar=1c17f84a-2f10-4ad0-9168-6201331ece4b>`_. The updated edition of the *User's Guide* will be included with future MEGA65 shipments. I will try to keep this *Welcome Guide* up to date, especially with short-lived tips and advice that won't be in the print guide.

I'm `Dan <https://www.dansanderson.com/>`_, known as dddaaannn in `the MEGA65 Discord <https://discord.gg/5DNvESf>`_. If you notice anything in this guide that needs updating, please `report an issue <https://github.com/dansanderson/mega65-welcome-guide/issues>`_. Thank you!
