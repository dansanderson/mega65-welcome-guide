MEGA65 Welcome Guide 2022
=========================

Hello! You've reached the MEGA65 Welcome Guide 2022. This Guide is intended for new owners of the `MEGA65 personal computer <https://mega65.org/>`_, specifically those that received their MEGA65 in the year 2022. It contains answers to common questions from early adopters not (yet) answered in the official documentation about the first production batch of hardware and factory-installed software, and recommends best practices for continued enjoyment of your new computer. It was written as an unofficial supplement to the MEGA65 User's Guide included with the computer.

Oh hi, I'm `Dan <https://www.dansanderson.com/>`_, known as dddaaannn#7325 in `the MEGA65 Discord <https://discord.gg/5DNvESf>`_ and `@dan_sanderson on Twitter <https://twitter.com/dan_sanderson>`_. If you notice anything in this guide that needs updating, or if you discover a topic not covered by the official manual that you feel new owners should know about, please `report an issue <https://github.com/dansanderson/mega65-welcome-guide/issues>`_. Thank you!
