# Things you'll need

For this Guide, you will need:

1. A PC running Windows, Mac, or Linux, with Internet access
2. An SD memory card reader for your PC, with microSD card support or an SD-to-microSD adapter
3. Your MEGA65 personal computer
4. Your personal registration code, included with the MEGA65 on a piece of paper
5. A monitor that supports either DVI (HDMI) or VGA, with an appropriate cable or adapter
6. If not using a monitor that supports audio over HDMI, speakers or headphones with a mini audio plug
7. A microSD memory card, type SDHC, between 4 GB and 32 GB
8. A Philips head screwdriver

The following are optional but will be fun additions to your MEGA65 experience:

9. A joystick or gamepad compatible with Commodore computers, with a nine-pin (DE-9) connector
10. A Commodore 1351 mouse, an Amiga mouse, or a modern replacement such as a [mouSTer](https://retrohax.net/shop/amiga/mouster/) USB mouse adapter
11. A CR1220 watch battery
12. 3-1/2" floppy disks, either type DD or HD

```{caution}
Do not connect a Sega Genesis game controller directly to the MEGA65 or Commodore computers! Sega Genesis controllers are not compatible and may damage the computer, even though they have the same connector. You can use an adapter such as [the BackBit GenAssister](https://store.backbit.io/product/genassister/).
